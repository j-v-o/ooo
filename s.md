- [What is GUID?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/GUID-global-unique-identifier) 
"GUIDs are constructed in a sequence of digits that equal 128 bits. The ID is in hexadecimal digits, meaning it uses the numbers 0 through 9 and letters A through F. The hexadecimal digits are grouped in a format that is 36 characters long -- 32 hexadecimal characters grouped as 8-4-4-4-12 and separated by four hyphens: {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}.
"Users do not need to rely on a centralized authority to administer GUIDs, as anyone can use a generation algorithm to create a GUID. Individuals and organizations can create GUIDs using a free GUID generator that is available online. An online generator constructs a unique GUID according to RFC 4122. When creating a GUID, users should note the timestamp, clock sequence and the node ID -- such as a Media Access Control (MAC) address.
